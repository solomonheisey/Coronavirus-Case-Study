The novel Coronavirus has effected everyone in some shape or form. One of the largest problems of this virus is the minute amount of information we currently know about it. This statistical analysis I have prepared aims to shed some light on the current situation and expose trends that are often hidden to the naked eye.

For this project, I am using the https://github.com/ramikrispin/coronavirus dataset. This is one of the most robust tidy format datasets which is pulled directly from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) Coronavirus repository. Below is a summary of the dataset.

This coronavirus dataset has the following fields:

* date - The date of the summary
* province - The province or state, when applicable
* country - The country or region name
* lat - Latitude point
* long - Longitude point
* type - the type of case (i.e., confirmed, death)
* cases - the number of daily cases (corresponding to the case type)

``` {r, echo=FALSE}
summary(coronavirus)
```


Shown below is a simple bar graph depicting the total number of confirmed cases on a per-country basis. The countries are sorted in descending order and listed below the graph is the raw data.


```{r, echo= FALSE}
summary_df <- coronavirus %>%
  filter(type == "confirmed") %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  arrange(-total_cases)

barchart <- summary_df %>% head(20)

dat <- data.frame(country = barchart$country, values = as.numeric(barchart$total_cases))
ggplot(data=dat, aes(x=reorder(country, -values), y=values, fill=values)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + ggtitle("COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Top 20 Countries") + labs(y="Confirmed Cases", x = "Country", fill="Confirmed Cases")  + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90), plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))

Show below is a tree map depicting the total number of recovered cases on a per-country basis. The countries are sorted in devcending order and the percentage represents the number of people who have recovered from the virus after previously being diagnosed.

``` {r, echo= FALSE}
conf_df <- coronavirus %>% 
  filter(type == "recovered") %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  arrange(-total_cases) %>%
  mutate(parents = "Recovered Cases") %>%
  ungroup() 

  top_20 <- conf_df %>% head(20)
  
  plot_ly(data = top_20,
          type= "treemap",
          values = ~total_cases,
          labels= ~ country,
          parents=  ~parents,
          domain = list(column=0),
          name = "Recovered",
          textinfo="label+value+percent parent")
```


``` {r, echo= FALSE}
coronavirus %>% 
  group_by(type, date) %>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = total_cases) %>%
  arrange(date) %>%
  mutate(active = confirmed - death - recovered) %>%
  mutate(active_total = cumsum(active),
                recovered_total = cumsum(recovered),
                death_total = cumsum(death)) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~ date,
                  y = ~ active_total,
                  name = 'Active',
