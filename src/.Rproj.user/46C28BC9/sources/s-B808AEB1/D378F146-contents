The novel Coronavirus has effected everyone in some shape or form. One of the largets problems of this virus is the minute amount of information we currently know about it. This statistical analysis I have prepared aims to shed some light on the current situation and expose trends that are often hidden to naked eye.

For this project I am using the https://github.com/ramikrispin/coronavirus dataset. This is one of the most robust tidy format datasets which is pulled directly from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) Cornovirus repository. Below is a short summary of the dataset.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RamiKrispin/coronavirus")
library(coronavirus)
library(dplyr)
update_dataset()
data("coronavirus")
```

``` {r, echo=FALSE}
summary(coronavirus)
```

```{r, echo= FALSE}
summary_df <- coronavirus %>%
  filter(type == "confirmed") %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  arrange(-total_cases)

summary_df %>% head(20)
```
